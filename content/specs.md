Despite the fact that I don't actually interact with this computer directly
very often, this is my "main" computer. It's where this website is running
actually!

I also use it as a gaming machine using PCIe-Passthrough to a Windows VM.
That was a massive headache to setup, but it's been working great ever since!

Built this thing after one trip to the local MicroCenter.

# 2022 Macbook Air M2, aka `nazuna`

It's a stock base-spec model. So an M2 chip, 8gb of RAM, 256gb of storage.
As Apple sells it.

Honestly? It's great. I've never used a laptop that's this efficient on both
battery and resources. It's shocking what MacOS can squeeze out of 8gb of RAM.
