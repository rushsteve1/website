When you're doing formal writing, for a blog, book, article, document, etc. you
will often have to refer to a figurative non-existent person or the reader, or
to an arbitrary member of a group, or some other case where you don't actually
know the identity of the person you're writing about.

In these cases, it is *imperative* to write in an inclusive style. This is of
course difficult in our world of gendered languages. Thankfully English isn't
as strongly gendered as many other languages, so there are some things we can
do to avoid exclusive writing.

I do have once piece of advice, a variant on an old adage:
<div style="text-align:center"><strong>
In truly inclusive writing no one should not notice you've done anything
differently at all.
</strong></div>

## Avoid Gendered Pronouns

The most obvious first step to inclusive writing is to avoid pronouns that are
inherently gendered, like "he" and "she". There is of course a very easy
solution:

<div style="text-align:center"><h4>Just use "they"</h4></div>

The words "they" and "them" are the gender and group agnostic and inclusive of
everyone! Anyone who insists that "they" is only for a group is both a pedant
and factually wrong. Singular "they" has been in use for centuries, even
Shakespeare did it.

If you use phrases like "he/she" you are immediately calling attention to the
fact that you're making a halfhearted effort to be inclusive, but aren't going
all the way.

## Avoid Gendered Words and Obviously-not-Gendered Words

It's immediately apparent that words like "mailman" which explicitly refer to
gender are not inclusive. But the naïve approach of simply replacing it with
"mailperson" is no better; It doesn't read right, is not in common usage, and
according to some dictionaries isn't even a real word. Words like this simply
sidestep the problem and don't solve it.

Instead, try to find words that are more descriptive or completely avoid any
reference to a gendered phrase. Example alternatives to "mailman" include
"postal worker", or "mail carrier".

## Dealing with Borrowed Words

While English is not a strongly-gendered language, we often borrow words from
other languages (such as Spanish and French) that **are** strongly gendered. The
solution is NOT to come up with strange anglicized versions like "Latinx" that
don't make any sense in their original language.

Instead, you generally have two options:

Firstly you could look to the host language and do what they do. For many
languages, this is the masculine-gendered version, such as "Latino". Understand
that this is not exclusive, in these languages the masculine version *is* the
gender-neutral version. Yes, this says a lot about human history, but you have
an article to write so the debate about historical gender politics can wait
(unless that IS your article).

Secondly, you can defer to what is most common in English. For certain words
this offers the path of least resistance. A common example would be the words
"fiancé" and "fiancée", masculine and feminine respectively, but the
latter is generally the more common usage and will surprise the reader less
often.
