Hey, welcome. Glad you could make it. This is my website, in all it's weird
and primary-color'd glory.

I occasionally do some public writing over [on the Blog](/blog).
Though that whole section is a constant WIP, so things might not all be working
quite right.

My public projects are listed [on the Projects](/projects) page.
This is also a WIP as I work on getting some of my old projects in a better
state for others to view.

Interested in hiring me? Check out my [Resume](/resume.pdf)
and my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/stevenvanzyl).

If you want to see the fancy animation again you can go back to the
<a href="/" data-no-swup>Landing page</a>.
