For better or worse I keep most of my projects [on GitHub here](https://github.com/rushsteve1).
These are just a few projects that I want to highlight.

## [This Website](https://github.com/rushsteve1/website)

The website you are on right now! It's a custom Zola template and some
markdown, but with a few extra tricks up its sleeve.

## [trash-d](https://github.com/rushsteve1/trash-d)

A near drop-in replacement for rm that uses the trash bin. Written in D.
Over 100 stars on GitHub, which I am quite proud of!

## [cgify](https://github.com/rushsteve1/cgify)

A simple static server in Go that also supports the Common Gateway Interface.
I use it on this site to handle the CGI pages.

## [SwissArmybot](https://github.com/rushsteve1/swissarmybot)

My many-times-rewritten Discord bot. These days it's mostly stable so
I generally leave it alone, but every now and then I'm inspire to
re-re-rewrite it.

## [plug_cgi](https://github.com/rushsteve1/plug_cgi)

Adapter to the Common Gateway Interface for Elixir's Plug library.
Available on Hex.pm too!
